**Agenda Item 1: Discussion on project topic** 

-   Prior to the meeting, the team read the different challenges from [VAST Challenge 2025](https://ieeevis.org/year/2025/welcome) to select our respective preferences.  

<!-- -->

-   The team disagreed to do the challenge as Yang Lu prefers [MC2](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2025/MC2.html), while Li JianYi prefers [MC3](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2024/MC3.html). 

<!-- -->

-   The team agreed on [MC3](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2025/MC3.html) as we thought that through the challenge, we could utilise what we have learned in class and add more insights from our own current knowledge bank. 

<!-- -->

-   The team also informed Audrey on the team’s choice of MC3 as she mentioned she was fine with any topic since she was on medical leave. 

**Action Items** 

-   All members will revisit the MC3 document to identify any gaps in understanding the knowledge graph’s structure and content.

2.  The distinction between Take-home Exercise 3 and the group project deliverable

3.  GitHub branching & collaboration workflow

**Agenda Item 1: UI Storyboard Template & Format**

**Template Style**

-   Adopt a clean “dark-blue” or similar professional colour palette to be consistent with the theme of the project.

-   Use consistent title headers, footers, and navigation bar mock-ups.

-   Print-screen of each implemented UI page

-   Capture one overall shot of each primary view in the app, such as the homepage, the detail page, and the filter/control panel, so the storyboard illustrates the full user journey.

**Agenda Item 2: Distinction Group Project Website (Covert Reef)**

-   Static homepage summarizing group methodology, team introduction and proposal.

-   May include embedded visuals, but not required to be Shiny.

-   Shared Netlify site under group account

-   GitHub repo link for group deliverable (proposal, poster, minutes).

## **Project Meeting 5**

**Date:** 23/06/2025 

**Time:** 8.00PM - 9:30 PM 

**In Attendance:** Li Jianyi, Yang Lu, Audrey 

**Agenda Items**

1.  Harmonization of data variables and nomenclature

2.  Website architecture and content framework

3.  Work distribution and consolidation approach

4.  Interactive vs static visualization deployment strategy

**Agenda Item 1: Harmonization of data variables and nomenclature**

-   **Issue Identified:** Inconsistent variable naming across individual team contributions creating merge conflicts

<!-- -->

-   **Resolution:** Establish unified naming standards for all data objects and variables prior to code integration

<!-- -->

-   **Implementation:** Conduct comprehensive review to synchronize nomenclature across all team member submissions

**Agenda Item 2: Website architecture and content framework**

-   **Data Preparation Section**: Decided to create a unified data preparation section combining all team members' preprocessing work

-   **Methodology vs Findings**: Clarified that methodology should cover overall approach, while findings will contain question-specific analyses

-   **Content Strategy:**

    -   Copy and paste shared components (packages, introduction, data preparation)

    -   Combine individual question analyses under findings section

    -   Maintain consistent formatting across all sections

**Agenda Item 3: Work distribution and consolidation approach**

**Analysis 1:** Primary implementation using Yang Lu's temporal heat map visualization, supplemented by Audrey's community structure analysis

**Analysis 2:**

-   **Component A:** Deploy Audrey's community detection visualizations (reference sections 7.5.8 through 7.5.11)

-   **Component B:** Incorporate Li Jianyi's network metrics including betweenness centrality calculations

-   **Integration:** Merge Audrey's visual community mapping with Jianyi's quantitative connectivity analysis (degree and betweenness centrality measures)

**Analysis 3:** Synthesize findings from Analyses 2A&B with 3A investigation, utilizing Audrey's Interactive Alluvial Diagrams as analytical foundation while ensuring coherence across related questions

**Analysis 4:** Maintain existing individual response with team validation

**Agenda Item 4:** **Interactive vs static visualization deployment strategy**

-   **Technical Constraint:** Shiny applications offer superior user interaction but lack direct Netlify compatibility

<!-- -->

-   **Hybrid Approach:**

    -   Preserve Shiny implementations for enhanced demonstration capabilities

    -   Develop static alternatives optimized for Netlify integration

<!-- -->

-   **Development Priority:** Emphasize functional delivery over visual sophistication for web deployment
