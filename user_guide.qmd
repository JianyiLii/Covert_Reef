# 1. Introduction

- **Accessing the site:** [https://dreytyw.shinyapps.io/VastChallengeCovertReef/](https://dreytyw.shinyapps.io/VastChallengeCovertReef/)

- **Purpose & scope:** Explain that _Covert Reef_ was created to answer questions in Vast 2025 Challenge.

- **Navigation overview:** Users are told to navigate with the sidebar. It has modules named: Introduction, Background, Setup, Data Preparation, Exploratory, Question1, Question2, Question3, Question4, Visit Vast Challenge.

- **Thematic Overview:** Prepare users on overview of words that will be in the story through a Wordcloud.

```

# 2. Background

- **Introduction to Final Product Tab:** Introduces users to the reason the website was created for the Vast Challenge. Provides Background of MC3.

- **Questions Tab:** Provides users with questions posted on MC3.

- **Data Tab:** Provides users with the general dataset information used for VAST Challenge.

- **Methodology:** Users informed about the general use of methodologies and graphs.


# 3. Setup

- **Yellow Boxes:**

  - **Package checklist:** Specified R CRAN supported packages utilized.

  - **Code to load packages:** Specified using pacman to check and load packages.

  - **Workarounds:** Specified that `magick` and `wordcloud2` may have compatibility or rendering issues within Shiny apps, so using `renderImage()`/`imageOutput()` and `renderWordcloud2()`/`wordcloud2Output()` ensures smoother, more reliable image and interactive word cloud rendering inside Shiny's reactive framework.

- **Green Boxes:**

  - **Loading Data:** Code chunk used from `jsonlite` package to import.

  - **Defining common variables:** User informed that styles and colours were kept as consistent as possible.

  - **Inspecting Knowledge Graph Structure:** Users informed that structure of the knowledge graph was first inspected.

  - **Extracting Edges and Nodes Table:** Structured JSON files provided in the VAST Challenge 2025 dataset:

    - `mc3_nodes.json`: Contains all entities (People, Vessels, Organizations, Groups, etc.)
    - `mc3_edges.json`: Communication links between entities (Sent, Received, Involved in, etc.)
    - Users informed that `as_tibble()` was used to extract nodes and edges from the raw mc3_data.

  - **Nodes Structure:** Users informed that Exploratory summary of nodes data using `SmartEDA::ExpData()`.

  - **Edges Structure:** Users informed that Exploratory summary of edges data using `SmartEDA::ExpData()`.


# 4. Data Preparation

a) **Nodes cleaning:**

   - Users informed of the summary of steps applied.

b) **Edges cleaning:**

   - Users informed of the summary of steps applied.

c) **Communication Extraction:**

   - Users informed of the logic applied to extract communication data.


# 5. Exploratory

- **Node-Level EDA:** Users can click the tab to view the overview, distribution of Node Type, Node SubType and, Observations by Node Type.

   - This is the view by hovering over the Information Icon

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/2.png")
```

Users can click the drop-down menu to select the unique node, and the interactive knowledge graph will respond to display the direct connections to other nodes. Then users can hover over the stars to read details like communicated content. Using the drop-down menu:

   - Click any unique node like Nadia Conti and view the direct nodes.
   - Hover over the stars to read the details.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/3.png")
```

# 6. Question 1: Communication Analysis

a) **Timeline Table**

   This shows overall communications.

   **Widget that filters the Timeline Table**

   - Use the date range to select time.
   - Filter by entity type (Person, Vessel, etc).
   - Narrow down by sender or recipient.
   - Reset to clear all selections.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/4.png")
```

b) **Communication Heatmap (All Time) Tab**

   **Heatmap:**
   - Hover over to see counts.

   **Widget:**
   - Select entity from drop-down.
   - Table shows who this entity communicated with most
   - Includes number of messages and contact subtypes.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/5.png")
```

c) **Week 1 vs Week 2 Communication Patterns:**

   Explain fluctuations between weeks by all or some entities.

   - Use the dropdown menu to select one or multiple group(s) (Person, Vessel, etc) to be included into the plot.
   - Deselecting all will hide data for that type.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/6.png")
```

d) **Time Filtered Chord Diagram, Timeline Table, and Static Heatmap by Time:**

   - Use the drop-down to choose an hourly window

   - Hover over heatmap to explore message volume by hour/date.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/7.png")
```

Findings shown here, can be collapsed to view the next Timeline Table.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/8.png")
```

Heatmap is static and not dynamic, as it shows an overview. The weekly dynamic timeline and other dynamic charts already captured similar information.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/9.png")
```

# 7. Question 2: Topic Clustering & Network Exploration

This is the Communication Table which will also be filtered:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/26.png")
```

**Keyword Query Timeline:**

- Click one keyword to show the timeline of messages mentioned with it.
- This will update the keyword timeline plot and filter the communications table below.
- Useful for quickly finding patterns of conversations by day and time tied to specific terms like 1045, Permit.
