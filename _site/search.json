    "text": "Clepper, a lead investigator on Oceanus, has been closely monitoring the closure of Nemo Reef. Over the span of two weeks, he and his intern listened to and analyzed radio communications and utilized his investigative tools to uncover a complex web of expedited approvals, hidden communication, and secretive logistics. Their investigation revealed a story involving high-level Oceanus officials, Sailor Shift’s team, local influential families, and the Green Guardians, who are a local conservationist group, pointing towards possibilities of corruption and manipulation. Amidst this investigation, Nadia Conti, a known figure formerly entangled in illegal fishing operations, has resurfaced as a person of interest. The project aims to develop new and novel visual analytics techniques to support Clepper’s investigation in uncovering the full extent of the events on Oceanus."

    "text": "Shiny Applications on Networks and Visualisations\n\n\nInputsOutputs\n\n\nThe Shiny app will include some of these parts.\n\nKnowledge graph\nAs the entire network is very large, containing 1,159 nodes and 3,226 edges, it is not suitable to visualize the entire network. Hence, we will plot with subgraphs and other visualisations.\n\n\nReference Node\nFor Nadia’s ego network, we require a reference node (Nadia).\n\n\nNetwork depth\nIn relation to the reference node, this serves to narrow down the network to view. The depth dictates how far from the reference node to network. As Nadia’s networks are at distance 1 or distance 2, we will add an option to toggle whether to render the full network or use the option to render by distance to the reference node.\n\n\n\n\nPlot area\nShows the network or visualisation plot. It will be interactive to enable closer inspection of network or visual elements.\n\n\n\n\nThese are some prototypes of the webpage and shiny application that we are planning to build for the project. The whole concept of this storyboard is mainly to allow the user to utilise interactive visualisations such as timeseries slides, clickable components, or hovers to get to the bottom of the activites brewing at Oceanus such as the Nemo Reef Operation. Hence, enhancing the whole user experience as they follow us along on uncovering the story."
