    "text": "Motivation\nClepper, a lead investigator on Oceanus, has been closely monitoring the closure of Nemo Reef. Over the span of two weeks, he and his intern listened to and analyzed radio communications and utilized his investigative tools to uncover a complex web of expedited approvals, hidden communication, and secretive logistics. Their investigation revealed a story involving high-level Oceanus officials, Sailor Shift’s team, local influential families, and the Green Guardians, who are a local conservationist group, pointing towards possibilities of corruption and manipulation. Amidst this investigation, Nadia Conti, a known figure formerly entangled in illegal fishing operations, has resurfaced as a person of interest. The project aims to develop new and novel visual analytics techniques to support Clepper’s investigation in uncovering the full extent of the events on Oceanus.\n\n\nObjectives\nThis project aims to build interactive visual analytics tools to uncover the story:\n\nIdentifying daily temporal patterns in communication to detect recurring message timings.\nAnalysing the shifts in communication patterns across the two weeks.\nFocus on specific entities to determine influence within the network.\n\nVisualising the interactions between people and vessels to explore the interactions and relationships in the knowledge graph.\nApplying community detection to uncover groups that are closely associated with the community and the topic areas predominant for each group.\nDetecting which person or vessel is using pseudonyms and unraveling them.\nIdentifying common entities in the knowledge graph.\nUnderstanding of the activities by unraveling pseudonyms and tracking their interactions.\nProviding evidence through visual analytics to determine whether Nadia Conti is engaging in illicit activity.\n\nPresenting a summary of Nadia’s actions and visual reasoning behind any suspicion.\n\n\n\nData\nThe project will examine the data from VAST Challenge 2025 Mini-Challenge 3. The data contains the information to build a knowledge graph describing the last two weeks on Oceanus. It contains 1,159 nodes and 3,226 edges.\nNodes are one of three types: Entity, Event, Relationship. Entities are connected via an edge to other Entities via an Event or Relationship node. The one exception to this is the Communication Event subtype, which is additionally linked via edge to either an Event or Relationship node.\n\n\nMethodology\nTo answer these questions, we investigated communications and relationships among entities. We did this by creating visualisations such as subgraphs of networks, chord diagrams, timeline plots, wordclouds, and circular bar charts. Then we tabled the findings, and discussion/ interpretations.\n\nDiagramCode\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\nA[in:mc3.json] --&gt;|Data Preparation| B(Read Input) \nB --&gt; C{Clean Data} \nC --&gt;|Save| E[Knowledge Graph] \nE --&gt;|Nodes + Edges| D[Extract sub-networks] \nC --&gt; M[Visualisations] \nM --&gt; R[Timeseries Plots] \nM --&gt; S[Chord Diagrams] \nM --&gt; T[Alluvial Diagrams] \nM --&gt; U[Wordclouds] \nU --&gt; V[Circular Barcharts] \nV --&gt; Z[Shiny App] \nT --&gt; Z[Shiny App] \nS --&gt; Z[Shiny App] \nR --&gt; Z[Shiny App] \n\nD --&gt; F[Ego Network] \nD --&gt;|Louvian| G[Commumity Network] \nD --&gt;|PageRank| G[Commumity Network] \nD --&gt; H[2-hop Network] \nF --&gt; Z[Shiny App] \nG --&gt; Z[Shiny App] \nH --&gt; Z[Shiny App] \n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation\n\nData Preparation: Cleaning data to what is required for analysis.\n\nCleaning nodes and edges\nLinking sender and recipient information.\n\nStatistical Analysis: To apply statistical methods to help in analysis\n\nPerform Louvain Community Detection\nCalculate measures of centrality to identify influential nodes\n\npagerank centrality for the nodes that hold the most influence\n\n\nData Exploration & Visualization: To identify patterns in the network and derive inferences from them.\n\nInteractive network graphs to see relationship between entities\nShiny app for users to interact and change parameters for analysis\n\nA time slider will be provided to easily see how the network changes through time\n\nBy looking at various network structures, identify the following:\n\nCommunications\nPseudonyms and Real Identities\n\n\n\n\n\nPrototype Sketches\n\nOur shiny app will look at network and temporal patterns, with the network graph as the core visualizations, with other tables and charts as accompanying visualization.\n\nInputsOutputs\n\n\nThe Shiny app will include some of these parts.\n\nKnowledge graph\nAs the entire network is very large, containing 1,159 nodes and 3,226 edges, it is not suitable to visualize the entire network. Hence, we will plot with subgraphs and other visualisations.\n\n\nReference Node\nFor Nadia’s ego network, we require a reference node (Nadia).\n\n\nNetwork depth\nIn relation to the reference node, this serves to narrow down the network to view. The depth dictates how far from the reference node to network. As Nadia’s networks are at distance 1 or distance 2, we will add an option to toggle whether to render the full network or use the option to render by distance to the reference node.\n\n\n\n\nPlot area\nShows the network plot. It will be interactive to enable closer inspection of network elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR Packages\nWe used the following R packages\n\nUtilityGraphingShiny App\n\n\n\njsonlite - To parse JSON\ntidyverse - Data science tools\nggtext - Tools for text formatting\nknitr - For better table displays\nlubridate - For processing date and time\nhms - For durations\nscales - For breaks and labels\ntidytext - For functions text mining\ndplyr - For transforming, filtering, summarising data\ntm - For text mining\nSnowBallC - For Porter’s word stemming\nmagick - For graphics and image processing\nSmartEDA - EDA with some graphing\nstringr - For wrapping\nreadr - For reading rectangular data\nreactable - For interactive data tables\n\n\n\n\nggraph - For plotting network data\ntidygraph - For graph manipulations\nigraph - Contains functions for network analysis\nggiraph - Interactive plots\nscales - Formatting ggplot scale\npatchwork - For combining ggplot plots\nplotly - Interactive plots\nwordcloud- For frequency representation of words\nggh4x - For axis, strip, and facet customizations\nvisNetwork - For interactive visualisation of networks.\nggplot2 - For building plots\nRColorBrewer - Colour schemes for graphics\ncirclize - For circular plots\nggalluvial - For alluvial diagrams\nwordcloud2 - For creating wordclouds\n\n\n\n\nshiny - Creating interactive apps in R\nshinywidgets - Extensions of shiny inputs\nshinyjs - Executing JS code in shiny for enabling and disabling Shiny inputs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Schedule\n\n\nShow code\npacman::p_load(vistime, ggplot2)\n\ndata &lt;- read.csv(text = \"event,group,start,end,color\n                       ,Project Proposal,2025-06-02,2025-06-08,#a5d6a7\n                       ,Exploratory data analysis,2025-05-20,2025-06-08,#a5d6a7\n                       ,Exploratory data analysis,2025-06-08,2025-06-09,#DD4B39\n                       ,R Quarto/ Netlify,2025-05-20,2025-06-08,#a5d6a7 \n                       ,R Quarto/ Netlify,2025-06-08,2025-06-30,#DD4B39\n                       ,R Shiny App,2025-06-15,2025-07-06,#DD4B39 \n                       ,Poster,2025-06-23,2025-06-26,#DD4B39\n                       ,User Guide,2025-06-15, 2025-06-26,#DD4B39\")\n\ndata$start &lt;- as.POSIXct(trimws(data$start), format = \"%Y-%m-%d\")\ndata$end &lt;- as.POSIXct(trimws(data$end), format = \"%Y-%m-%d\")\n\nproposal_deadline &lt;- as.Date(\"2025-06-08\")\n\np &lt;- gg_vistime(data, title = \"Project Timeline\")\np +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(as.POSIXct(\"2025-06-08\")), color = \"red\", size = 1)"
