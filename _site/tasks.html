|2040-10-05 10:48:00 |Sam         |Kelly                |Hey Kelly, it's Sam. This permit approval seems fishy. Could you get details on who signed off on it while you're at the harbor? I need to understand these 'special access corridors' before my meeting with Elise tomorrow.                                                              |
|2040-10-01 08:13:00 |Kelly       |Sam                  |Sam, it's Kelly! Let's meet at Sunrise Point at 7 AM for birdwatching. Bring your new binoculars and some water. I've heard there might be some rare shorebirds passing through this weekend. Can't wait!                                                                                  |
|2040-10-07 08:11:00 |Kelly       |Sam                  |Hey Sam, it's Kelly! Got some photos of those crates - definitely marked 'fragile' and 'handle with care.' Neptune's crew is being super secretive. They're using special loading equipment I've never seen before. See you at 7 for birdwatching!                                         |
|2040-10-05 09:45:00 |Nadia Conti |Haacklee Harbor      |Haacklee Harbor, this is Nadia Conti. I need to cancel the special access corridor arrangements for Nemo Reef immediately. Plans have changed due to unforeseen circumstances. Destroy all related documentation. I'll contact you when we're ready to proceed with alternative locations. |
|2040-10-05 09:49:00 |Nadia Conti |Oceanus City Council |This is Nadia Conti. My cancellation was due to scheduling conflicts with our tourism development initiatives. I wasn't aware of any permit approvals. I'll submit revised documentation for alternative sustainable tourism proposals next week.                                          |
|2040-10-08 08:18:00 |Nadia Conti |Liam Thorne          |Liam, Nadia here. Need your services urgently. Investigation brewing around Nemo Reef permits. Double your usual fee if you can ensure Harbor Master remains cooperative through next week. Meet at the usual place tomorrow, 10PM.                                                        |
|2040-10-08 08:25:00 |Nadia Conti |Neptune              |Neptune, this is Nadia. Need clarity on 'underwater foundation work' at Nemo Reef. This extends beyond our agreed scope. Meet me at the marina tomorrow at 6AM to discuss implications and additional resource requirements.                                                               |
|2040-10-08 08:30:00 |Nadia Conti |Neptune              |Neptune, Nadia here. Just confirming our 0600 meeting at the marina. I've reviewed the modified equipment specs with The Accountant. Please bring detailed timeline for foundation work and cost implications. We need to stay under radar.                                                |
|2040-10-08 11:23:00 |Nadia Conti |Marlin               |Marlin, Nadia here. I understand you're inquiring about eastern shoal routes. Those are temporary diversions due to equipment transport needs. I'll have Davis provide the necessary documentation tonight. Nothing to be concerned about.                                                 |
|2040-10-12 08:44:00 |Nadia Conti |Liam Thorne          |Liam, Nadia here. Redirect all remaining operations from southwest immediately. Move equipment to our secondary location. I'll handle EcoVigil through proper channels. Meet me at the usual place at 2100 hours with updated documentation.                                               |</code></pre>

<p>The thickness of each ribbon (chord) represents the magnitude of the relationship. A thicker ribbon represents more frequent communications (sent + received) between a sender and recipient.</p>
<p>Here, we have an overview of paired communicators who have higher frequencies. We also can see the links between communicators. These are the entities who communicated frequently with others that we might want to focus on:</p>

<p>We also noticed that at times, certain individuals sent messages but there were no response back. This could possibly be due to the pseudonyms being used to send or reply to the same content. For instance, there was a message from Davis to Rodriguez on 14 Oct around 1200-1400 but there was no response by Rodriguez. By looking at the content field, we then found out that he was Small Fry due to the responses he provided to Davis which was originally addressed to Rodriguez.</p>

<p>The visualization of hourly communication patterns reveals that message activity in Oceanus follows a pronounced daily cycle, with distinct peaks and lows across both observed weeks.</p>
<p>In Week 1, communication is highly concentrated in the morning hours, particularly between 8 AM and 12 PM, where a majority of the messages are exchanged.</p>
<p>By contrast, Week 2 shows a broader distribution of communication throughout the day, with notable increases in afternoon and evening activity.</p>
<p>This shift suggests that while the first week’s communications were more focused and possibly related to regular planning or operational updates, the second week’s patterns reflect heightened activity or more dynamic coordination, potentially due to emergent events or increased urgency among entities.</p>

<li><p>Core logic:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If two names appear as sender and recipient in the same message, they cannot belong to the same person — i.e., they’re not aliases of each other.</p></li>
<li><p>If two names sent a message at the exact time, they cannot belong to the same person.</p></li>
<li><p>For instance, if Nadia sent a message to The Accountant, they would not be the same individual. If Nadia sent a message at 10am to The Accountant and The Lookout also sent a message at 10am to The Intern, Nadia and The Lookout cannot be the same person.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Select only The Accountant, Mrs.&nbsp;Money, Elise: We see close timings between Mrs.&nbsp;Money and Elise on 8 Oct, and 10 Oct.&nbsp;These were on the same topic. Elise then disappears from radar on 10 Oct.&nbsp;She reappears as The Accountant and Mrs.&nbsp;Money on 11 Oct on the same topic and remains only as The Accountant till 14 Oct.</p></li>
<li><p>Select only Liam and The Middleman: The Middleman disappeared on 7 Oct and appeared as Liam on 8 Oct.&nbsp;On 11 Oct Mrs.&nbsp;Money asked The Middleman if anything was found by conservation vessels. On the same day, Liam reappeared and replied Elise that nothing was found by them.</p></li>
<li><p>Select only The Boss and Nadia: The Boss disappeared on 5 Oct and reappeared as Nadia on 8 Oct.&nbsp;Likely the same person.</p></li>
<li><p>Select only Small Fry and Rodriguez: on 2 Oct Rodriguez corresponded with Remora and Mako on meeting at the slip #14. It happened again on 14 Oct as he took on dual roles and responded to the same message with different names. Likely the same person.</p></li>
<li><p>Select only The Lookout and Sam: on 7 Oct Sam asked Kelly to get information on who authorized the permit. 2 minutes later, The Lookout (Kelly) responded to The Intern (Sam), that it was signed by Jensen from City Council.</p></li>
<li><p>Seawatch only appeared on 10 Oct but Horizon talked to Seawatch on 8 Oct.&nbsp;Therefore, some other entity is Seawatch before or during 8 Oct.&nbsp;Defender told Seawatch on 3 Oct at 8.39am that it increased its patrol and informed Seawatch to maintain vigilance. The Lookout (Seawatch) responded to Sentinel (Defender) at 8.41am that it acknowledged the need for vigilance.</p></li>
<li><p>After getting a general idea of the characters’ involvement, we looked at the interactions in 7.3.</p></li>

<ul>
<li>Movements and changes in membership since section 1.1.2:
<ul>
<li>Mako moved from Maritime to Conservationist.</li>
<li>Samantha Blake moved from the Suspicious Characters to Conservationist.</li>
<li>Sam and Kelly moved from their own Community to Pseudonym.</li>
<li>The Lookout moved from Conservationist Group to Pseudonym.</li>
<li>The Intern moved from Suspicious Characters to Pseudonym.</li>
<li>Sailor Shift community renamed to Permit</li>
</ul></li>
<li>From 11 nodes in section 7.5.6.1, we further narrowed down on the 8 nodes in the suspicious groups named:
<ul>
<li>Permit (Influential Nodes: Neptune, Remora, Nadia, Davis);</li>
<li>Conservationist Group (Influential Node: Mako);</li>
<li>Suspicious (Influential Nodes: Mrs.&nbsp;Money, Boss, The Middleman).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We held back on the slightly less influential nodes such as: Hacklee Herald which was where Clepper Jensen worked as a journalist.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="discussion-interpretation">2.7 Discussion/ Interpretation:</h3>
<p>We mainly focused on the conversations by 8 influential nodes and some related nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Conservation Group</strong> (Comm.1): Samantha Blake informed Mako to stop operations on 8 and 10th Oct.&nbsp;Serenity is a private luxury yacht. Osprey was likely a tourism vessel looking for charter from Mako for their tourists.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Permit</strong> (Comm. 2): Neptune, Remora, Nadia, and Davis were working on Nemo Reef operation. This referred to the Music Video Production for Sailor Shift on 14 Oct.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pseudonym</strong> (Comm. 3): Other than communicating among themselves, The Lookout appeared to have also externally corresponded with Sentinel, Reef Guardian and Horizon (conservation based topics), while The Intern also externally corresponded with Mrs.&nbsp;Money.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Suspicious</strong> (Comm. 4): The Middleman had access to Council documents. Mrs.&nbsp;Money had funding from sources that would not flag out to regulators for her operations. Mrs.&nbsp;Money was investigating V. Miesel’s structures. On 5 Oct, Boss told Mrs.&nbsp;Money to disguise financial trails through tourism ventures and destroy evidence of Nemo Reef operations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hacklee Herald</strong> (Comm. 5): Conversations between Clepper and his intern Miranda which ended on 11 Oct.&nbsp;Miranda mentioned an Oceanus City Council Member meeting with unmarked vessels at night.</p></li>

<li><p>If two names appear as sender and recipient in the same message, they cannot belong to the same person — i.e., they’re not aliases of each other.</p></li>

<h1>Question 3b)</h1>
<p>We created a graph with the character’s original name, pseudonyms, and supplemented with any background information we learnt of. For instance, we learnt that Davis was a captain, or that Serenity was a private luxury yacht.Here, it is easier to determine who is using which pseudonyms by clicking on the real identity drop down panel which will then only segregate to the individual’s Real Identity, Observed Name, and Community.</p>

<section id="question-3c" class="level1">
<h1>Question 3c)</h1>
<p>Understanding pseudonyms significantly reshapes our interpretation of the events in Oceanus. Without resolving aliases, the communication network appears fragmented — it may seem like dozens of separate individuals are involved. However, by mapping pseudonyms to real identities, we discover that a small number of actors are coordinating more activity than initially apparent. For example, a person using multiple pseudonyms may appear in many places at once — suggesting high influence or deception. This reveals orchestrated behavior, such as coordinated logistics, manipulation of event timelines, or masking involvement in controversial operations.</p>

<li>The orange community were possibly involved in Sailor Shifts’s music video, while the green community were likely regarding ensuring compliance to authorities such as officials, the harbour and conservation team.</li>
<li>Nadia, Elise, and Marlin were the orange nodes that directly linked to the green nodes.</li>

<p>We then wanted to find more about the correspondences. The first graph illustrated Nadia’s sent communications and the second graph were her received communications. Hover over nodes to see the sent or received count from the perspective of the entity. Hover over arrowheads to see the number, direction, count, first and last correspondence time, type of sent or received, and content of one communication. Nadia sent only 8 but received 18 communications (possibly indicative of using a pseudonym):</p>

<li><p>Nodes involved: Nadia, Davis, Elise, Haacklee Habor, Liam, Marlin, Neptune, Oceanus City Council, Remora, Rodriguez, Sailor Shifts Team, Sentinel, V. Miesel Shipping.</p></li>
<li><p>Sent more direct communications to Liam (2) and Neptune (2), relative to others.</p></li>
<li><p>Received more from Davis (5), Elise (3), and Liam (2), relative to others.</p></li>
<li><p>The next step would be to find out the suspicious characters/ activities.</p></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nadias-ego-network-3-hops-degree-centrality">4.3 Nadia’s Ego Network: 3-hops degree centrality</h2>
<p>To uncover more details, we designed n-hops degree centrality here. We input 3 hops to hover over the nodes and look into the communications in a wider network. 3-hop exposes overlapping communites (Nadia communicating with someone who coordinates between groups). The “bridges” may show their value in 3-hops. It also increases the change of detecting complete or near complete cliques. We understand that should there be requirements for details, we could look into n-hops and more.</p>
