<section id="methodology" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methodology"><strong>Methodology</strong></h3>
<p>To build this prototype module, we adopted a structured visual analytics approach, starting from data ingestion to visual storytelling. The knowledge graph provided in Mini-Challenge 3 was first cleaned, transformed, and modeled using tidygraph. Communication patterns, relationships, and anomalies were then extracted through modular analysis and visualized using both static (ggplot2, ggraph) and interactive (plotly, visNetwork) tools.</p>
<p>The overall methodology consists of the following stages:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><code>Data Preparation</code> We loaded and flattened the JSON-based knowledge graph, extracted nodes and edges, cleaned missing values, and validated the network structure for compatibility with tidygraph. Each entity was classified by type and sub-type to enable filtering and targeted analysis.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Modular Task Execution</code> Each of the four investigative tasks was assigned to team member, allowing parallel and comparison development:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Temporal trends were analyzed by aggregating communication timestamps by hour and date.</li>
<li>Entity relationships were explored through network graph layouts and centrality measures.</li>
<li>Anomaly detection used Z-score normalization on daily message counts.</li>
<li>Suspicious activity was investigated through person-to-person messaging analysis.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p><code>Prototype Development</code> All modules were translated into reactive components suitable for a Shiny application. Input widgets such as selectInput(), dateRangeInput(), and checkboxGroupInput() allow user-driven filtering, while outputs include plotlyOutput() and visNetworkOutput() for dynamic and exploratory analysis.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Design and Storyboarding</code> A UI storyboard was drafted to guide the layout of the final Shiny app, ensuring usability and clarity. Each module was built to function independently but integrate smoothly into the full application.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Entities are connected by edges to other Entities via an Event or Relationship node. The one exception to this is the Communication Event subtype, which is additionally linked to either an Event or Relationship node. The type field denotes the connector or edge type for the Entities, Event, and Relationship nodes. The edges are one of these: received, evidence_for, sent, NA.</p>

<li><p>For relationship as colleagues node or friends node, the node will have arrows/ edges pointing towards the relationship node.</p></li>
<li><p>For other relationships and events, the direction would be following the source and target.</p></li>
