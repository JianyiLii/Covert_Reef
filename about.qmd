## Yang Lu

My name is Yang Lu, and Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Master at Singapore Management University, specializing in the Financial Technology& Analytics track. 
In this Visual Analytics and Applications course, I focus on harnessing the power of RStudio to transform complex financial datasets into clear, actionable insights. My work includes data wrangling with **tidyverse**, creating interactive visualizations with **ggplot2** and **plotly**, and building dashboards using **shiny**. I am passionate about applying these skills to real-world fintech challenges and continuously learning new tools and techniques to advance my analytical toolkit.

## Li Jianyi

My name is Jianyi, and I came into the Visual Analytics module hoping to learn how to turn complex data into clear and engaging visuals. The module exceeded my expectations by equipping me with practical skills in R, Shiny, and Quarto, while also teaching me the importance of design, storytelling, and user experience in data communication. I especially enjoyed building interactive dashboards and applying visual thinking to real-world scenarios. I believe these skills will be valuable in future projects, business reporting, and communicating insights to both technical and non-technical audiences.
