🕵️ About the Project
Covert Reef is our visual analytics investigation for the 2025 VAST Challenge Mini-Challenge 3 (MC3). This challenge simulates a fictional crisis scenario in the Oceanus, where intelligence suggests the involvement of covert networks.

Our team dives into large-scale communication logs to explore hidden patterns of interaction. Using R, Shiny, and advanced data visualisation techniques, we identify key actors, map suspicious activities, and expose potential malicious plots.
